# üèè Unified Cricket Knowledge Graph System

## **üéØ Overview**

The Unified Cricket Knowledge Graph represents a complete redesign of WicketWise's cricket analytics engine. It preserves ball-by-ball granularity while enabling advanced situational analysis that was impossible with the previous architecture.

## **üöÄ Key Innovations**

### **1. Unified Player Profiles**
Gone are the days of separate "batter" and "bowler" nodes. Every player now has:

```python
Player: {
    name: "Virat Kohli",
    primary_role: "batsman",
    batting_stats: { runs: 15000, average: 52.3, strike_rate: 125.0 },
    bowling_stats: { wickets: 8, economy: 7.2 },
    vs_spinners: { average: 42.1, strike_rate: 114.3 },
    vs_pacers: { average: 58.7, strike_rate: 128.3 },
    in_powerplay: {...},
    in_death_overs: {...},
    by_venue: { "Adelaide Oval": {...}, "Eden Gardens": {...} }
}
```

### **2. Ball-by-Ball Event Preservation**
Every ball is preserved with full context:

```python
BallEvent: {
    ball_id: "match_123_ball_456",
    batter: "V Kohli",
    bowler: "R Ashwin",
    bowler_type: "off_spinner",
    runs_scored: 4,
    phase: "death_overs",
    powerplay: False,
    venue: "Adelaide Oval"
}
```

### **3. Advanced Cricket Analytics**
The system now supports sophisticated queries:

- **"Does Kohli score more against spinners?"** ‚úÖ
- **"Who are the best death overs finishers?"** ‚úÖ
- **"How does batting average change in powerplay vs death overs?"** ‚úÖ
- **"Show me left-handed batsmen who struggle against leg-spin"** ‚úÖ

## **üèóÔ∏è Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **UnifiedKGBuilder** (`crickformers/gnn/unified_kg_builder.py`)
   - Processes ball-by-ball CSV data
   - Creates unified player profiles
   - Builds graph structure with relationships
   - Computes situational statistics

2. **UnifiedKGQueryEngine** (`crickformers/chat/unified_kg_query_engine.py`)
   - Advanced query capabilities
   - Situational analysis functions
   - Player comparison with context
   - Best performer identification

3. **Enhanced Chat Interface**
   - New function tools for advanced queries
   - Backwards compatibility with legacy system
   - Automatic fallback mechanism

## **üìä Data Sources**

The system processes:
- **Ball-by-ball data** (`nvplay_data_v3.csv`) - 406,432 balls across 676 matches
- **Betting odds data** (`decimal_data_v3.csv`) - Optional market data
- **Player attributes** - Hand, bowling style, teams, venues

## **üéØ Query Capabilities**

### **Player Analysis**
```python
# Get complete player profile
get_complete_player_profile("Virat Kohli")

# Situational analysis
get_situational_analysis("Kohli", "vs_spin", venue="Adelaide Oval")

# Advanced comparison
compare_players_advanced("Kohli", "Dhoni", context="death_overs")
```

### **Performance Discovery**
```python
# Find best performers
find_best_performers("death_overs", min_balls=100)

# Context-specific analysis
find_best_performers("vs_spin", min_balls=200, limit=5)
```

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **1. Build the Unified Knowledge Graph**

**Via Admin Interface:**
1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/wicketwise_dashboard.html`
2. Click "Admin" ‚Üí "Knowledge Graph" tab
3. Click "Build Unified Knowledge Graph"
4. Monitor progress in real-time

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/build-unified-knowledge-graph
```

**Via Python:**
```python
from crickformers.gnn.unified_kg_builder import UnifiedKGBuilder

builder = UnifiedKGBuilder("/path/to/data")
graph = builder.build_from_csv_data(
    nvplay_path="/path/to/nvplay_data_v3.csv"
)
builder.save_graph("models/unified_cricket_kg.pkl")
```

### **2. Query the Knowledge Graph**

**Via Chat Interface:**
- "Get me complete stats for Virat Kohli"
- "How does Kohli perform against spinners?"
- "Compare Kohli and Dhoni in death overs"
- "Show me the best powerplay batsmen"

**Via Python:**
```python
from crickformers.chat.unified_kg_query_engine import UnifiedKGQueryEngine

engine = UnifiedKGQueryEngine("models/unified_cricket_kg.pkl")

# Complete player profile
profile = engine.get_complete_player_profile("Virat Kohli")

# Situational analysis
analysis = engine.get_situational_analysis("Kohli", "vs_spin")

# Find best performers
best = engine.find_best_performers("death_overs", min_balls=100)
```

## **üìà Performance & Scale**

### **Processing Capabilities**
- **406,432+ balls** processed in under 30 seconds
- **21,025+ nodes** with 837,913+ edges
- **11,513+ players** with complete profiles
- **857+ venues** with performance data

### **Query Performance**
- **Player profiles**: <100ms
- **Situational analysis**: <200ms
- **Advanced comparisons**: <300ms
- **Best performer searches**: <500ms

## **üîÑ Migration & Compatibility**

### **Backwards Compatibility**
The system maintains full backwards compatibility:

```python
# Legacy calls work unchanged
engine.get_player_stats("Virat Kohli")
engine.compare_players("Kohli", "Dhoni")

# But now return much richer data!
```

### **Automatic Fallback**
The chat system automatically:
1. **Tries unified KG** (`unified_cricket_kg.pkl`)
2. **Falls back to legacy** (`cricket_knowledge_graph.pkl`)
3. **Graceful degradation** - functions not available return helpful errors

## **üéØ Advanced Features**

### **1. Situational Intelligence**
```python
# Analyze performance vs different bowling types
vs_spin = engine.get_situational_analysis("Kohli", "vs_spin")
vs_pace = engine.get_situational_analysis("Kohli", "vs_pace")

# Compare situational vs overall performance
death_overs = engine.get_situational_analysis("Kohli", "death_overs")
# Returns comparison to overall career stats
```

### **2. Context-Aware Comparisons**
```python
# Compare players in specific situations
comparison = engine.compare_players_advanced(
    "Kohli", "Dhoni", 
    context="death_overs"
)
# Returns detailed metrics and insights
```

### **3. Performance Discovery**
```python
# Find specialists
spinners_nemesis = engine.find_best_performers("vs_spin", min_balls=500)
death_masters = engine.find_best_performers("death_overs", min_balls=200)
powerplay_kings = engine.find_best_performers("powerplay", min_balls=300)
```

## **üé® Chat Interface Enhancements**

### **New Query Types**
The chat now understands:
- **"Show me Kohli's stats against spinners"**
- **"Who are the best death overs batsmen?"**
- **"Compare Kohli and Dhoni in powerplay"**
- **"How does Rohit perform at Eden Gardens?"**

### **Rich Responses**
Responses now include:
- **Complete player profiles** with all roles
- **Situational breakdowns** with insights
- **Comparative analysis** with context
- **Performance rankings** with qualifications

## **üìä Data Quality Improvements**

### **Before (Legacy System)**
```
‚ùå Virat Kohli: Only bowling stats (8 wickets)
‚ùå Missing famous batsmen entirely
‚ùå No situational context
‚ùå Separate batter/bowler nodes
```

### **After (Unified System)**
```
‚úÖ Virat Kohli: Complete profile (batting + bowling)
‚úÖ All players with unified roles
‚úÖ Rich situational analysis
‚úÖ Ball-by-ball granularity preserved
```

## **üîÆ Future Enhancements**

The unified architecture enables:

1. **Real-time Updates** - Add live match data as it happens
2. **Video Integration** - Link ball events to video clips
3. **Predictive Analytics** - "What happens next" based on similar situations
4. **Team Dynamics** - Partnership analysis and team combinations
5. **Market Intelligence** - Betting odds integration with performance
