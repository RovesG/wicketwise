## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **1. Enrichment Data Integration**
```python
# Automatic enrichment loading
def _load_enrichment_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load 3,980 enriched matches with weather and venue data"""
    
# Weather node creation
def _add_weather_nodes(self, match_key, enrichment, stats):
    """Add weather nodes with temperature, humidity, wind data"""
    
# Venue enhancement
def _enhance_venue_nodes(self, enrichment, stats):
    """Enhance venues with coordinates, city, country, timezone"""
    
# Match context integration
def _add_match_context(self, match_key, enrichment, stats):
    """Add competition, format, teams, toss, timing data"""
```

### **2. Graph Structure Enhancement**
```python
# New node types added
NODE_TYPES = {
    'player': 'Cricket players with enhanced stats',
    'venue': 'Venues with coordinates and characteristics', 
    'match': 'Matches with context and weather data',
    'weather': 'Weather conditions for specific matches'  # NEW!
}

# New relationship types
RELATIONSHIPS = {
    'played_in_weather': 'Match → Weather conditions',
    'weather_at_venue': 'Venue → Weather patterns',
    'match_context': 'Match → Competition/format data'
}
```

### **3. Data Structure Handling**
```python
# Handles actual enrichment data format
ENRICHMENT_STRUCTURE = {
    'competition': 'Caribbean Premier League',
    'format': 'T20',
    'venue': {
        'name': 'Warner Park',
        'city': 'Basseterre', 
        'country': 'Saint Kitts and Nevis',
        'latitude': 17.302,
        'longitude': -62.717,
        'timezone': 'UTC'
    },
    'teams': [
        {'name': 'Barbados Royals', 'is_home': True},
        {'name': 'Jamaica Tallawahs', 'is_home': False}
    ],
    'weather_hourly': [],  # Weather data when available
    'toss': {'won_by': 'team', 'decision': 'bat/bowl'}
}
```
