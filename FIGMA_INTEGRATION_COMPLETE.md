2. **`render_figma_card()`** - Glass morphism cards with hover effects  
3. **`render_figma_navigation()`** - Modern pill-shaped navigation
4. **`render_figma_stats_panel()`** - Statistics grid with cricket data

### **📁 Files Modified**

- ✅ `ui_style.py` - Added Figma-inspired components
- ✅ `figma_site_analyzer.py` - Analysis and conversion tool
